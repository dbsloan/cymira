# CyMIRA
The Cytonuclear Molecular Interactions Reference for Arabidopsis

![](CyMIRA_logo.png)


CyMIRA is a detailed classification of genes involved in cytonuclear interactions in Arabidopsis thaliana. CyMIRA integrates existing subcellular localization, cytonuclear pathways/complexes, and structural data to formulate a consistent annotation of cytonuclear genes for use in genomic studies of cytonuclear coevolution in plants.

The current version of the dataset is available for download from this repository as a tab-delimited text file and an Excel spreadsheet. A queryable web interface is also available at http://cymira.colostate.edu/.
